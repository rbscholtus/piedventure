"""Module to simulate a player's interaction within a dimly lit, eerie room.

The player enters a room with a lever on the wall and an exit leading back north.
The function narrates the scene and allows the player to perform actions such as
moving, interacting with the lever, and giving humorous commands. Depending on the
state of the lever, the player can turn it on or be notified if it's already on.

    """Introduce the player to a dim room with a lever and prompts for actions.

    The player steps into a room with a retro-style carpet and a lever on the wall.
    The function describes the room and checks the state of the lever (on or off).
    The player can interact with the environment by issuing commands to move or manipulate
    the lever. Depending on the player's input, they can either return to the main room,
    toggle the lever, or perform humorous non-actions.

    Args:

        lever state and passed to the mainroom function when returning.
